1. App Requirements and Goals The app I developed, SensorScope, was designed to provide users with real-time sensor data in a clean, accessible format. The primary goal was to create a modular, secure, and user-centered experience that supports diverse health and fitness goals. It addressed user needs for minimal data entry, clear visual feedback, and ethical permission handling.

2. Screens and Features Supporting User Needs To support user needs, I implemented a login screen, dashboard, sensor data viewer, and settings panel. Each screen was designed with clarity and accessibility in mind. I used consistent layouts, intuitive navigation, and responsive design principles. These choices made the app easy to use and visually appealing, contributing to a successful user experience.

3. Coding Approach and Strategies I approached coding with a modular mindset, breaking the app into reusable components. I used version control, clear naming conventions, and documented each module for maintainability. These strategies helped me stay organized and will be valuable in future projects, especially when scaling or collaborating with others.

4. Testing for Functionality I tested the app using the Android Emulator, log outputs, and problem tabs. This iterative testing process was essential for catching bugs early and ensuring stability. It revealed areas where user input validation needed improvement and helped me refine the appâ€™s performance across different devices.

5. Innovation and Problem Solving One challenge I faced was integrating sensor data while maintaining a clean UI. I had to innovate by designing a dashboard that could display dynamic data without overwhelming the user. I used visual hierarchy and modular design to solve this, ensuring the interface remained intuitive.

6. Demonstrating Knowledge and Skills I was particularly successful in implementing secure login and permission handling. This component showcased my understanding of Android best practices, user privacy, and ethical design. It also reflected my ability to troubleshoot and refine features through persistent testing and iteration.
